My personal vim/shell configuration files

To install:
 1. Install the [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) package manager
 2. Copy the vimrc.txt file into ~/.vimrc
 3. Copy the colors/ folder into ~/.vim/colors/ (not necessary, might have to remove some lines from ~/.vimrc if not using this)
 3. Launch vim and run :PluginInstall
 
Other plugins:
 1. [ctags](https://andrew.stwrt.ca/posts/vim-ctags/)
 2. [taglist](http://vim-taglist.sourceforge.net/)

Generate ctags with instructions on their website.

The only thing in ~/.bashrc makes 'ls' have colorful output like default linux. Probably not necessary on linux.
